# Data Science Capstone & Ethics (ENGI E4800)

## Course overview

This course provides a unique opportunity for students in the MS in Data Science program to apply their knowledge of the foundations, theory and methods of data science to address data driven problems in industry, research, government and the non-profit sector. The course activities focus on a semester-long project sponsored by an affiliate company or a Columbia faculty member. The project synthesizes the statistical, computational, engineering and social challenges involved in solving complex real-world problems. The course has a well developed Ethics component supported by Dr. Savannah Thais. 

## Project Overview

Project Name: Multi-Modal Search using RAG 

Affliated company: L'Oréal USA

We developed a multi-modal shopping assistant for L'Oréal leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance product discoverability and user experience. The assistant interprets natural language queries (e.g., “small brown wallet under $20 with good reviews”) by extracting keywords and constraints, embedding them alongside a product database built from text and image data (via CLIP, BLIP, and Sentence Transformers), and performing similarity search with FAISS. Results are ranked and refined with the OpenAI API to deliver context-aware, curated product recommendations through an interactive Streamlit interface, creating an intuitive and intelligent shopping experience.
